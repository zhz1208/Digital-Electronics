I find this wearable Arduino-driven electronic fashion bag extremely interesting. The idea of the project is inspired by the design of [Bao Bao bag](https://www.isseymiyake.com/en/brands/baobao) by a Japanese fashion designer Issey Miyake, who is famous for his technology-driven clothing designs. The original Bao Bao bag is flashy with its material, shape and pattern. Kimbab uses colorful LEDs in triangle shapes to make the surface of the newly remodeled smart Bao Bao bag. Controlled by an Arduino UNO, the surface can show customized patterns and animations. In his [demo video](https://youtu.be/EZ4qKqp91Pk), the light effect of the bag is glorious. It will definitely be an eye-catcher when walking on the street with it.
